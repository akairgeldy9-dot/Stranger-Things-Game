            <p>You decide you don't need Eleven's help. Armed with makeshift equipment and determination, your group approaches the portal.</p>

            <p>You try to resist, but you're not Eleven. You don't have powers. You're just kids.</p>
            
            <p>One by one, the Mind Flayer's tendrils wrap around each of you, invading your minds.</p>
