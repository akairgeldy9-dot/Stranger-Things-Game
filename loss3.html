            <p>Fueled by anger and fear, you burst through the door and confront Dr. Brenner.</p>
            
            <p>"We know what you're doing!" you shout. "You're opening gates to the Upside Down!"</p>
            
            <p>Dr. Brenner's cold eyes fix on you. He doesn't look surprised - he looks pleased.</p>
            
            <p>"How fascinating," he says calmly. "More children with knowledge of our work."</p>
            
            <p>He presses a button. Alarms blare. Security guards flood the room within seconds.</p>
            
            <p>You try to run, but there's no escape. Strong hands grab you and your friends.</p>
            
            <p>The last thing you remember is a needle, a bright light, and Dr. Brenner's voice: "Don't worry. You won't remember any of this."</p>
            
            <p>When you wake up, you're in your bed. It's morning. You can't remember why you feel so uneasy.</p>
            
            <p>Who were you looking for? What were you investigating? It's all... gone.</p>
