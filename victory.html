            <p>You find Eleven at the old Byers house. She looks tired but determined. "I can do this," she says. "But I'll need all of you with me."</p>
            
            <p>Together, you return to the woods. The portal has grown larger, crackling with dangerous energy. Creatures stir on the other side.</p>
            
            <p>Eleven steps forward, blood dripping from her nose. She raises her hand. "Friends... don't let go."</p>
            
            <p>You all join hands, forming a circle around her. Mike holds her other hand. The power builds. The air vibrates.</p>
            
            <p>"CLOSE!" Eleven screams.</p>
            
            <p>With a blinding flash of light and a deafening crack, the portal implodes. The red glow vanishes. The creatures' screams fade into silence.</p>
            
            <p>Eleven collapses, but she's smiling. "It's... done."</p>
            
            <p>The sun begins to rise over Hawkins. The town is safe. Your friendship saved the world once again.</p>
