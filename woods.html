            <p>You leave your bike by the road and venture into the woods alone. The temperature drops. Your breath becomes visible in the cold air.</p>
            
            <p>The trees seem to close in around you. The red glow gets brighter as you push through the undergrowth.</p>
            
            <p>Then you see it - a swirling, glowing tear in reality itself. It pulses with red energy. You can hear strange sounds coming from the other side... growling, clicking noises.</p>
            
            <p>The portal seems to be calling to you.</p>
