            <p>You and your friends bike through the night to Hawkins Lab. The facility looms before you - cold, clinical, and foreboding.</p>
            
            <p>Mike finds a loose panel in the fence. You slip through one by one. Security guards patrol with flashlights, their footsteps echoing on the pavement.</p>
            
            <p>Through a window, you see Dr. Brenner in a white coat, talking to someone. Documents are spread across a table - they might contain information about the gate.</p>
            
            <p>Lucas spots an unlocked side door. "We could sneak in and grab those files," he whispers.</p>
            
            <p>But then you hear it - Eleven's voice on your walkie-talkie again: "Don't... too dangerous... find me instead..."</p>
            
            <p class="question">What do you do?</p>
