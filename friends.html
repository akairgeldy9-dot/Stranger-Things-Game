            <p>Within 20 minutes, Mike, Dustin, and Lucas arrive at your house with flashlights, backpacks, and determination. You tell them what you saw.</p>
            
            <p>"Sounds like the Upside Down is back," Mike says grimly. "We need to investigate, but we need a plan."</p>
            
            <p>Dustin pulls out a map. "We can check the woods together, or we could try to get into Hawkins Lab. They might have information about what's happening."</p>
