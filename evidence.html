            <p>You have a Polaroid photo of the portal. The image is unsettling - the red glow seems to move even in the still photograph.</p>
            
            <p>Your friends gather around, studying the evidence. "This is real," Lucas whispers. "The gate is opening again."</p>
            
            <p>Suddenly, your walkie-talkie crackles to life. A familiar voice breaks through the static.</p>
            
            <p>"Hello? Is... is anyone there? This is Eleven. I sense the gate. I can help... but I need you to find me. I'm at the old Byers house."</p>
            
            <p>Mike's eyes light up. "El! She can close the gate like before!"</p>
            
            <p>But Dustin looks worried. "Or we could try the abandoned cabin. There might be equipment there we could use to close it ourselves without putting El in danger."</p>
            
            <p class="question">What's your decision?</p>
