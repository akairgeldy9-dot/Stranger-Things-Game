            <p>Your hand reaches toward the swirling portal. The energy feels cold... so cold.</p>
            
            <p>The moment your fingers touch the edge, something grabs you from the other side.</p>
            
            <p>You're yanked through the portal before you can scream. The world inverts. Everything is dark, decaying, covered in vines and ash.</p>
            
            <p>You hear a clicking sound behind you. You turn slowly.</p>
            
            <p>A Demogorgon stands there, its face opening like a horrific flower of teeth.</p>
            
            <p>You try to run, but the vines wrap around your ankles. The portal has closed behind you.</p>
            
            <p>You're trapped in the Upside Down... forever.</p>
